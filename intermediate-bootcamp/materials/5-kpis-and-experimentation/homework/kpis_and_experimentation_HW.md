# Netflix KPIs & Experimentation

I have been a Netflix user since 2018. As a big fan of movies and series, I appreciate the comfort and convenience Netflix brings to my daily life. Initially, I was hesitant to commit to a subscription, but the desire to finally watch *Friends* convinced me. What impressed me early on was the smooth UI, low-latency experience, and the broad selection of films and TV shows available anytime.  

Being able to watch on my smartphone is another huge plus, as I can enjoy content before falling asleep or during flights, thanks to Netflix’s offline mode. I’ve also discovered many new and old favorites through the recommendation system and intuitive search features.  

Since I value Netflix so much, I propose three experiments aimed at enhancing user experience and driving further success for the platform.

## Experiment 1: Netflix's Movies of the Week
**Objective:**  
Introduce a feature that highlights two personalized recommendations each week: one timeless classic and one fresh release. These “Movies of the Week” will be based on users’ viewing history and preferences. The aim is to increase retention by solving the common problem of “not knowing what to watch.”

- **Null Hypothesis:** The feature does not increase user retention (activity & subscription renewal).  
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** The feature increases user activity, leading to more subscription renewals.  
- **Leading Metric:** Number of movies watched per week.  
- **Lagging Metric:** Increase in subscription renewals.  
- **Test Cell Allocation:** 50% - 50%

## Experiment 2: Sleep-Friendly Suggestions
**Objective:**  
Introduce a dedicated category of movies and series optimized for late-night viewing — shorter in duration, relaxing, and not overly intense. The goal is to drive higher user activity in late-night hours, making Netflix the default choice over competitors in these scenarios.

- **Null Hypothesis:** No significant difference in engagement between users exposed to Sleep-Friendly suggestions and those who are not.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** Users exposed to Sleep-Friendly suggestions show higher engagement and late-night activity.  
- **Leading Metric:** Increase in late-night user activity.  
- **Lagging Metric:** Percentage of users continuing to engage with Sleep-Friendly content over time.  
- **Test Cell Allocation:** 75% - 25%

## Experiment 3: Netflix's Smart Offline Mode
**Objective:**  
Enable an auto-download feature where Netflix reserves a small, user-defined amount of storage. For regularly watched series, the app will automatically download upcoming episodes for offline access. This ensures seamless viewing during travel or when internet access is limited.  

- **Null Hypothesis:** No significant difference in engagement between users with access to Smart Offline Mode and those without.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** Users with Smart Offline Mode exhibit higher activity compared to those without.  
- **Leading Metric:** Average time spent on Netflix.  
- **Lagging Metric:** Subscription retention over a specified period.  
- **Test Cell Allocation:** 75% - 25%
